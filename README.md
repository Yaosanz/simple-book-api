## Introduction

Welcome to the Simple Book API, a minimalistic Node.js application built with the Express framework. This API serves as a basic foundation for managing a collection of books, providing simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.

## Features

- **Create:** Add new books to the collection.
- **Read:** Retrieve information about existing books.
- **Update:** Modify details of a specific book.
- **Delete:** Remove a book from the collection.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (Node Package Manager)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/syanzzz/simple-book-api.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd simple-book-api
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```

## Usage

1. Start the server:
